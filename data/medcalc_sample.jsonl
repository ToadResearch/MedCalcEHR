Additionally, the patient had developed a left lateral neck mass which progressively increased in size over the past 9 months. Patient denied tenderness to palpation of the mass and dysphagia. His past medical history was significant for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, GERD, chronic hepatitis C, polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). His past surgical history was remarkable for thyroid malignancy treatment with radioactive iodine and total thyroidectomy in addition to a gunshot wound. Family and social history were not significant. On physical exam, a left supraclavicular soft tissue mass 6 cm in diameter was appreciated, it was non-tender with no submandibular lymphadenopathy. A soft tissue mass was also palpable on the anterior abdominal wall in the epigastric region.\nGiven the patient's malignant history, significant weight loss in the past 3 weeks with increasing left mass size, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Initial studies included ultrasound of the abdomen for workup of acute pancreatitis with findings unremarkable for the body of the pancreas and the head and tail not being visualized. CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed pulmonary nodules in the posterior segment of the right lower lobe of the lung and bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe, PKD and bilateral hepatic cysts. Oncology was consulted, and a CT of the chest and neck were ordered in addition to a chest X-ray that was remarkable for two pulmonary nodules with an enlarged paratracheal node. Pulmonology was consulted, and the patient was recommended to follow-up in 6 months for surveillance of the pulmonary nodules. ENT and Surgery were consulted, and an excisional lymph node biopsy was pursued due to suspicion of possible recurrence of previous thyroid malignancy or metastases (). Histopathology revealed metastatic mucin-producing adenocarcinoma. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on paraffin sections revealed the neoplastic cells were positive for CK20 and CDX2. The cells were negative for CK7, TTF-1, p63, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PACP), chromogranin, synaptophysin and S-100. Gastroenterology was consulted, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed including an antral biopsy of the gastric mucosa, which was unremarkable. Colonoscopy of the lower GI tract revealed a 6 cm obstructing mass in the transverse colon and a biopsy was taken revealing findings of invasive well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features, focally present in subserosal tissue with ten of eleven regional lymph nodes involved. This confirmed the primary cancer originated from the colonic mass and metastasized to the left lateral neck mass (Virchow’s node).\nSurgical intervention was pursued with resection of the transverse colon with primary end-to-end anastomosis.

The patient presented with intermittent abdominal distension, which was slightly under no obvious inducement, with no fever, emesis, nausea, or vomiting. Physical examination found no signs of abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness, and liver and spleen were impalpable.\nLaboratory examination results were as follows: blood routine examination (hemoglobin 132 g/L, red blood cell count 4.61 × 10 12/L, white blood cell count 10.04 × 10 9/L, blood platelet count 180 × 10 12/L), liver enzymes (ALT 10.0 U/L, AST 17.0 U/L, GGT 16.0 U/L, ALP 86.0 U/L, TBIL 12.7 μmol/L) and renal function (BUN 5.65 mmol/L, SCr 42.0 μmol/L). Serum tumor markers AFP, CA19-9, CEA, and CA125 were all within normal limits.\nHer past medical history included hemangioma for 20 years, and asthma for 30 years, and she underwent hysteromyomectomy 8 years ago. She did not smoke or drink. The splenic ultrasound revealed multiple hypoechogenic foci measuring 5 to 38 mm in diameter. The contrast-enhanced CT showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the spleen, mottled low-density lesions, multiple hypoattenuating nodules with no contrast enhancement on the arterious phase. Delayed contrast-enhanced helical CT scan displayed incomplete filling of hypodense splenic lesions. Imaging findings raised the suspicion of a vascular neoplasm of the spleen (Fig. A and B).\nGiven that it was uncertain whether it was a benign or a malignant tumor of the spleen, a laparoscopic total splenectomy was performed for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment and informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images. Grossly, the spleen measured 11 cm × 6.5 cm × 2.5 cm. The largest lesion measured 2 cm × 2.3 cm × 3.6 cm. Histopathologically, the tumor was characterized by multiple cystic structures with anastomosing vascular channels (H & E staining ×50) (Fig. ). Photomicrograph of the histologic specimen (H & E staining ×400) showed a high power view of the cystic structures demonstrating tall columnar endothelial cells without cytologic or nuclear atypia that lined the cyst-like spaces (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry showed that the cells compromising the tumor were positive for CD21, CD31, CD68, and CD163 (Fig. ).\nAccording to the histology and immunohistochemistry findings, the diagnosis of LCA of the spleen was thus established. The patient was discharged 6 days after the splenectomy. Her postsurgical course was uneventful, intermittent abdominal distention disappeared, and no surgery-related complications were found. After surgery, Aspirin (100 mg qd) was used to prevent thrombosis. One month after discharge, the patient's blood routine and clotting routine were normal, and Aspirin was stopped to use. The follow-up imaging findings at 16 months after surgery showed no signs of recurrence. From the patient perspective, the result of surgical treatment was satisfactory.", "Question": "Using the 2021 CKD-EPI Creatinine equation, what is the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) in terms of mL/min/1.73 m²?", "Relevant Entities": "{'sex': 'Female', 'creatinine': [42.0, 'µmol/L'], 'age': [32, 'years']}", "Ground Truth Answer": "127.718", "Lower Limit": "121.3321", "Upper Limit": "134.1039", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 32 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 42.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 42.0 µmol. To convert 42.0 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 42.0 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 4.2e-05 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 4.2e-05 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.005 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.005 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.005 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 5.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 5.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 0.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 42.0 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 0.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is less than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -0.241.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (0.5/0.7)**-0.241 * 0.9938**32 * 1.012 = 127.718.\nHence, the GFR value is 127.718 ml/min/1.73 m²."}

The patient's medical history, according to her family, included recurrent acute bronchitis until 10 years of age. No history of alcohol or tobacco consumption or psychoactive substance use was reported. The patient was very selective and restrictive in her meals since her childhood. She only ate biscuits, ham croquettes, bread, and omelettes.\nRegarding school, she described acceptable performance until the previous academic year when she presented some difficulties, and her teachers decided to change her to another classroom with a lower academic level.\nHer premorbid personality was described as quiet and shy, with some difficulty in social relationships, but with a group of friends at the beginning of the episode. She lived with her parents and an 18-year-old sister in a mid-size city (with a population of about 216,000 inhabitants).\nThe patient reported that during the previous academic year she had been separated from her friends due to the change of classroom and at the same time she had begun to suffer digestive cramps and headaches, and as a result she stopped going to school. She stayed at home, with no interest in leaving the house, playing computer games and surfing the internet all day from April 2013 until her admission in our department 6 months later. The family explained that she had also become withdrawn from them, showing little interest in conversation, giving only monosyllabic answers, and gesturing in response to her parents' questions. She showed neglect in her personal hygiene and apathy regarding her physical appearance.\nAt the time of her admission, the mental status examination showed she was conscious and oriented in time, place, and person, though unkempt and exhibiting psychomotor retardation, poor eye contact, and limited language, answering questions with monosyllables or gestures. She also displayed emotional lability when discussing sensitive issues like friends and school and showed hypothymia, poorly reactive mood, apathy, weakness, and anhedonia and was only interested in computer usage. She did not exhibit impaired sensory perception, self-referentiality, or psychotic behavior, though she was sleeping from 4:00 am to noon. Her food intake was very selective, limited to certain specific foods, but there was no loss of appetite.

She denied muscular pain and no goiter or myxedema.\nSoon after admission, a blood test and electrocardiogram (EKG) were performed. EKG, liver function tests, electrolytes, and whole blood count were within normal limits. Due to her isolation at home and selective food intake, levels of some vitamins were analyzed; vitamin D3 and folic acid levels were insufficient (vitamin D3: 20.9 ng/mL insufficient with levels above 30 ng/mL and folic acid: 2.3 ng/mL insufficient with levels above 3 ng/mL). The thyroid function test showed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels of 24.159 mIU/L (reference range: 0.400–4.00), free thyroxine (FT4) 0.93 ng/dL (reference range: 0.80–2.00), and triiodothyronine (T3) 1.08 ng/mL (reference range: 0.70–1.90), with antithyroid peroxidase antibodies >1300 IU/mL (reference range: <35).\nWe requested interconsultation with the endocrinology department where hypothyroidism secondary to Hashimoto's thyroiditis was diagnosed, and treatment with levothyroxine 50 micrograms/day was recommended.

Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) revealed pH 7.423, PaCO2 37.3 mmHg, PaO2 50.1 mmHg, SaO2 86.5% (FiO2 0.2). The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was increased to 53 but his chest x-ray was normal. On the 3rd hospital day, dyspnea and hypoxemia worsened and chest computed tomography (CT) was performed due to suspected PE. Chest CT scan showed thromboembolism in the right interlobar pulmonary artery, right lower lobe segmental artery and subsegmental pulmonary artery (). Heparin treatment was initiated immediately and dyspnea and hypoxemia improved. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed on the 4th hospital day without showing any abnormality or thrombus. On the 7th hospital day, left lower limb venography was taken but there was no venous thrombus and an inferior vena cava filter was not inserted. The patient was scheduled for an operation 11 days after the accident.\nDuring heparin administration activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was maintained between 60 and 67 sec and heparin was stopped at midnight on the day before the operation. Prothrombin time and aPTT were within normal range on the day of operation. Laboratory tests were within normal range except BUN/Cr which was increased to 23.7/1.5 mg/dl.\nThe patient was not premedicated. On arrival in the operating room, standard monitoring devices were applied. After Allen's test, the left radial artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring and the initial blood pressure (BP) was 120/70 mmHg. 5 L of 100% O2 was applied to the patient via oxygen mask and initial ABGA showed pH 7.43, PaCO2 38.1 mmHg, PaO2 102.9 mmHg, and SaO2 98%. Spinal anesthesia was administered with the patient in the right lateral position using a 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle at the level of the L3-4 interspace under standard aseptic conditions. A total of 12 mg of 0.5% tetracaine, mixed with saline, the patient's CSF, and epinephrine 1 : 200,000 was administered slowly to the patient. The patient was then positioned supine and a sensory block to T10 was confirmed by pin-prick test 5 min later. During spinal anesthesia, 700 ml of Hartmann's solution was administered to the patient and there were no significant changes in BP or heart rate (HR). Forty min after spinal anesthesia, a pneumatic tourniquet was inflated on the left thigh. It was inflated to 350 mmHg, without prior use of an Esmarch bandage. Immediately after the skin incision was made, the patient became unresponsive with BP 50/30 mmHg and HR 40 bpm. Ephedrine hydrochloride 8 mg was administered intravenously followed by another 12 mg but BP did not increase. Phenylephrine 300 µg was administered and endotracheal intubation was performed immediately and the patient was ventilated with 100% oxygen. BP increased to 80/70 mmHg but cardiac arrest then followed, and external cardiac massage was initiated. The patient received epinephrine 1 mg and atropine 0.5 mg repeatedly for 4 times without any response and infusion of epinephrine 0.1 µg/kg/min and norepinephrine 0.1 µg/kg/min was started. Fifteen min after cardiopulmonary resuscitation was instituted, HR increased to 140 bpm and BP increased to 140/90 mmHg.

Her medical history was remarkable for heterozygote alpha-thalassemia, but negative for thrombotic and recurrent infectious events. The family history was also negative for thrombotic events or bleeding tendency. The patient was not treated with anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors. Physical examination was normal (BMI 23.0 kg/m2, blood pressure 125/70 mmHg, heart rate 85/min, normal heart sounds, and no vascular murmurs). After the exclusion of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, hyperviscosity, and sickle cell disease, a thrombophilia workup was performed. All hemostatic laboratory parameters were found normal except for an increased protein S activity (179%) with high free protein S level (207%), despite a normal total protein S antigen level (98%) (Table ). This suggested that, in contrast to normal conditions, all protein S was free protein S, instead of 30–40% free and 60–70% bound protein S. High activity and antigen levels of free protein S were confirmed in a separate sample 3 months later. Clinically, a protein S deficiency is considered as a possible cause of hypercoagulation, which in turn could have led to the retinopathy. The incidental finding of elevated protein S levels were not considered explanatory of the condition. We did not initiate anticoagulation or thrombocyte aggregation inhibition. The patient's vision did not improve remarkably, nor did it deteriorate in the subsequent months after her initial visit.\nThe high free protein S level in the proband was caused by a reduced level of C4BP (18%), as measured with an ELISA against the α-chain of C4BP. To identify a possible molecular defect underlying the C4BP deficiency, we sequenced the protein-coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of C4BPA (encoding C4BPα, ) and C4BPB (encoding C4BPβ, ).\nWe identified two previously reported non-synonymous variants in C4BPA, that is, c.719G>A (p.R240H), rs45574833 ((A=0.0140/1686 (ExAC), A = 0.0030/15 (1000 Genomes), A = 0.0095/124 (GO-ESP), A = 0.0078/227 (TOPMED)), and c.899T>C (p.I300T), rs4844573 (C = 0.4014/47780 [ExAC], C = 0.4898/2453 [1000 Genomes], C = 0.4841/6296 [GO-ESP], T = 0.4689/13653 [TOPMED]).\nIn addition, we screened the father and brother for these mutations. Both are also Surinamese. Only p.I300T was present in the father (Fig. ). Both father and brother had normal free protein S levels. Mother, second sister, and second brother were unavailable for testing.\nDiscordant data concerning the association between C4BP polymorphisms and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported , . Furthermore, these two variants have also been identified in women experiencing recurrent miscarriages, but due to equally high frequencies between patients and controls, the importance of these variants in this particular clinical situation may be questionable . No mutations were found in the C4BPB gene.\nBecause we could not find clear molecular defect in the C4BP gene responsible for the reduced expression, and a recent report indicated that binding of protein S to C4BP promotes cellular secretion of C4BP , we also sequenced the sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)-like region of protein S (), responsible for binding to C4BP using the previously published primers , . No mutations explaining a reduced binding of protein S to C4BP were found in the SHBG-domain of protein S.\nAlthough the medical records did not report any use of vitamin K antagonist, we excluded the interference of any form of vitamin K antagonists by the measurement of coagulation factors II, VII, and X which were all normal, except for factor X which was slightly increased (163%) (Table ). Furthermore, there was no indication of reduced capacity of liver synthesis with normal antithrombin and factor V levels.

Meanwhile, the patient was prepared for laparotomy where, during the surgery, her sugar levels kept under control, control, stress-dose cortisol was provided, and she received 5 units of PC and 4 units of FFP.\nDuring the laparotomy, about 3 L of blood and clot were removed from the abdomen. Following this, a cystic lesion was observed in the vicinity of the large stomach flexion that bled due to the invasion of the gastroepyloid vessels (Figure ). After controlling the bleeding, the lesion was fully resected, and samples were examined for pathology (Figure ).\nPostoperatively, complete control of the bleeding was achieved with sustained vital signs.

Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device.

Her proteinuria was not detected before March 2011 by screening test by the family doctor. At admission, her height was 153 cm, weight was 40 kg, and blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg with treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day. Physical examination showed bilateral pitting edema of her legs and palpable superficial inguinal lymphadenopathies.\nLaboratory results were as follows: serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL; sodium 138.8 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL; white blood cells 12,300/μL; platelet count 42,000/μL; serum total proteins 7.4 g/dL; and albumin 2.1 g/dL; total cholesterol 224 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 119 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 60 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL. She had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody (28 IU/mL). Tests were negative for anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B, anti-SS-A, and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies. Her CH50 level was low (14.3 U/mL). Microscopic urinalysis showed 51–100 red blood cells and 3–5 white blood cells per hyper field. Proteinuria was 9.3 g/day and selectivity index was 0.01. Chest and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities. She was diagnosed with SLE based on thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, positive ANA with anti-dsDNA antibody, and history of photosensitivity.\nBefore renal biopsy, we decided to treat her by prednisolone (PSL) 40 mg/day to normalize platelet count. Five days after the treatment, platelet count increased to 127,000/μL. Renal biopsy was performed 7 days after the treatment. The specimen for light microscopy contained 26 glomeruli; 8 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 revealed focal endocapillary hypercellularity superimposed on several foam cells (Fig. ).\nImmunofluorescence (IF) showed low-intensity diffuse global granular capillary staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. Analysis by electron microscopy (EM) revealed electron-dense glomerular basement membrane deposits and foot process effacement (Fig. ).\nThis patient would have been diagnosed as LN class III (A) + V or III (A) because of scanty subepithelial immune deposition; however, we observed focal segmental foam cells closely resembling the cellular variant of FSGS. Based on experience with FSGS from July 2011, we added cyclosporine 100 mg/day on the initiated treatment with PSL. Within 3 months, the patient’s proteinuria rapidly improved from 9.3 to 1.8 g/day, and her leg edema completely disappeared. Her CH50 level gradually increased, and her anti-dsDNA antibody titer decreased below the normal limit (Fig. ). In March 2012, we performed a kidney re-biopsy. We observed focal segmental sclerotic lesions and endocapillary foam cells. IF with IgG, C3, and C1q showed bright granular staining, and EM showed electron-dense deposits at the same site.

He had multiple comorbidities: old pulmonary tuberculosis, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. His medications included spironolactone, glimepiride, metformin, amlodipine, and telmisartan. Two weeks earlier, however, he was diagnosed with pulmonary aspergillosis and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation at the outpatient department (OPD). A pulmonologist and a cardiologist prescribed oral voriconazole (200 mg twice a day) and dronedarone (400 mg twice a day), respectively. At this time, serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 5.5 mmol/L, and creatinine was 0.91 mg/dL. shows the chest radiographic findings.\nAt admission, the patient's blood pressure was 124/52 mmHg, and no focal neurologic deficit was noted on physical examination. Serum sodium was 133 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 9.3 mg/dL, phosphorus was 4.7 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.57 mg/dL. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation and left bundle branch block (). The severe hyperkalemia appeared to be caused by spironolactone and telmisartan coadministration, and these offending agents were discontinued. In addition, hyperkalemia was antagonized by intravenous calcium gluconate and was corrected by administration of intravenous insulin lispro and calcium polystyrene sulfonate. His proteinuria was persistent, reaching 1,131 mg/d in a 24 h urine collection. Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.007, pH 5.0, albumin 1+, red blood cells 5–9/high power field (HPF), and white blood cells 3-4/HPF. Because monoclonal gammopathy was suggested from serum and urine protein electrophoresis, a kidney biopsy was performed. Light microscopic examination revealed two global scleroses among 17 glomeruli sampled and showed marked mesangial expansion with mesangial hypercellularity and global thickening of the glomerular capillary walls. Immunofluorescence revealed lambda light chain-restricted glomerular mesangial and linear capillary loop staining (). Electron microscopic evaluation showed vague, fine granular, amorphous deposits in the mesangium and along the peripheral capillary walls. These pathologic findings were compatible with light chain deposition disease. The immunofixation test revealed that heavy and light chains were IgG and λ, respectively. However, no osteolytic lesions were found, and the bone marrow was normocellular. Thus, he was discharged without specific treatment while maintaining voriconazole.\nNine days later, the patient was readmitted because of gait disturbance and dysarthria. Brain imaging revealed no acute lesion. Bradyarrhythmia was noted (), and acute hemodialysis was undertaken to treat both hypercalcemia (11.7 mg/dL) and hyperkalemia (7.5 mmol/L).

The transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) was calculated to be 2.02, and arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH of 7.354, pCO2 38.5 mmHg, pO2 110 mmHg, and HCO3− 20.9 mmol/L. Results of the following endocrine tests were unremarkable: plasma renin activity, serum aldosterone concentration, intact-PTH, and stimulated cortisol. Vitamin D levels were low, and PTH-related peptide was undetectable. We considered the possibility of voriconazole-induced hyperkalemia; therefore, voriconazole was discontinued. Because the follow-up ECG showed the atrial fibrillation was resolved, dronedarone was discontinued. At discharge, his serum sodium was 135 mmol/L, potassium was 4.1 mmol/L, calcium was 9.5 mg/dL, phosphorus was 3.7 mg/dL, protein was 7.5 g/dL, albumin was 3.1 g/dL, and creatinine was 0.69 mg/dL.\nApproximately one month later, the patient was readmitted because of massive hemoptysis and required bronchial artery embolization. The pulmonologist prescribed itraconazole to treat pulmonary aspergillosis. One week later, however, itraconazole was switched to a reduced dose (100 mg twice a day) of voriconazole. In the meantime, antihypertensives were switched to manidipine and propranolol.\nSixteen days after voriconazole had been resumed, serum potassium had increased to 5.7 mmol/L, and one day later, the patient again visited the ER because of chest tightness. His serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium was 8.0 mmol/L, calcium was 8.9 mg/dL, phosphorus was 5.8 mg/dL, and creatinine was 1.63 mg/dL. An ECG suggested complete atrioventricular block (), and he recovered normal sinus rhythm after acute hemodialysis (). Once again, voriconazole was replaced with itraconazole (200 mg once a day). Manidipine was discontinued because of the potential drug interaction between azole antifungals and calcium channel blockers. Plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone were 0.26 (normal, 0.32–1.84) ng/mL/h and 3.0 (normal, 4.2–20.9) ng/dL, respectively. No further electrolyte disturbances were noted during the admission for three weeks, and his final follow-up laboratory findings were: serum sodium 136 mmol/L, potassium 4.4 mmol/L, calcium 9.6 mg/dL, phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL, and creatinine 0.85 mg/dL.", "Question": "What is the patient's Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)?

The patient is a smoker, making the smoking variable equal to 1.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg.\nThe patient has been specified to take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 1.\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 198.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 198.0 mg. To convert 198.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 198.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.198 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.198 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.000512 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.000512 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000512 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.512 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.512 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 5.12 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 198.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 5.12 mmol total cholestrol/L. \nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 42.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 42.0 mg. To convert 42.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 42.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.042 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.042 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000109 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000109 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000109 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.109 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.109 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 1.09 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 42.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 1.09 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score:  52.00961 * ln(51) + 20.014077 * ln(5.12) + -0.905964 * ln(1.09) + 1.305784 * ln(140.0) + 0.241549 * 1  + 12.096316 * 1 + -4.605038 * ln(51) * ln(5.12) + -2.84367 * ln(51) * 1 + -2.93323 * ln(51) * ln(51) -  172.300168 = -2.5.\nPlugging this into the MI risk equation gives us 1 - 0.9402^exp(-2.5) = 0.0 %.\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %."}

We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 77.0 = 77.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 77.0 - 10 = 67.0.\nThe patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 67.0.\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 30 points to the score, making the current total 67.0 + 30 = 97.0.\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 97.0.\nCHF History is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 97.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 97.0.\nRenal Disease History is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 97.0.\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 97.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 97.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 78.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 97.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 98.6 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 66.6 = 37.0 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 97.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.45. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 97.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 97.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 135.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 97.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 20.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 97.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 140.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mEq. To convert from 140.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 140.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 140.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 140.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 140.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 97.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 6.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 6.9 mmol. To convert 6.9 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 6.9 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.007 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.261 g glucose. To convert 1.261 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.261 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1261.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1261.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 6.9 mmol glucose/L converts to 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 97.0.\nThe patient's hemocratit is 42.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 97.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 78.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 97.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 97.0."}

The results of the physical examination were as follows: height 165.0 cm, weight 60.2 kg, systolic blood pressure 132 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure 77 mmHg. Breast development and pubic hair growth were both stage 5 according to the Tanner staging system. Basal hormonal tests revealed highly elevated serum FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (52.7 IU/L and 33.2 IU/L, respectively), a low estradiol (E2) level (17.8 pg/mL), and high AMH level (5.04 ng/mL).

The patient also complained of general pruritus but no malaise, joint pain or muscle pain. Body temperature, respiration, and pulse were normal. His blood pressure was elevated at 182/94 mm Hg. His body height, body weight, and body mass index were 165 cm, 52 kg, and 19.1, respectively.\nOn physical examination, a firm, superficial, erythematous nodule measuring approximately 1 × 2 cm was noted within the lower, inner quadrant of the right breast. There was no nipple discharge, history of trauma, or cancer history. Given the possibility of breast carcinoma, the patient was admitted for further evaluation. Upon admission, initial laboratory results revealed: BUN, 40 mg/dl; creatinine, 28.63 mg/dl, C-reactive protein, 7.04 mg/L; hemoglobin, 6.3 g/dl; and a white blood count, 6700 /ml, with a left shift.\nChest X-ray upon admission showed increased patchy infiltrates bilaterally and a non-contrast chest CT was performed for further evaluation. The chest CT revealed diffuse patchy airspace consolidation and patchy pulmonary alveolar infiltrates with fine interstitial thickening over both lung fields, most severe within the left upper lobe and right lower lobe (Figure ). The primary diagnosis was atypical pneumonia. Differential diagnosis included asymmetric pulmonary edema and multifocal bronchoalveolar carcinoma.\nSputum culture, sputum cytology, serum mycoplasma antibody, and legionella antibody were performed. Azithromycin and augmentin were begun for possible atypical pneumonia. Sputum cytology was negative for malignant cells. Sputum culture, however, revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca (without tubercle bacillus). Appropriate antibiotic therapy was continued and repeat serial chest X-rays, performed during his hospital stay, showed resolution of the alveolar infiltrates, bilaterally.\nIncidentally noted on chest CT was a small oval nodular lesion measuring approximately 1.0 cm × 0.6 cm over the inferior and medial aspect of the right breast with infiltration within the subcutaneous adipose tissue (Figure ). As the nature of the breast nodule was unclear, a breast ultrasound (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) was recommended for further evaluation. Breast sonography revealed an oval, heterogeneous, predominantly hypoechoic nodule within the right breast measuring 1.35 cm × 0.39 cm in size between 3 and 4 o’clock, 2 cm from the nipple, with a faint echogenic interface, partially indistinct margin, and increased blood flow signals on color Doppler (Figure ).

As this presentation was felt to be unusual in a male breast, breast malignancy was suspected. As the patient refused mammography or MRI, a sono-guided biopsy of the lesion was performed using an 18-gauge core biopsy needle (Figure ). Pathology from four strips tissue revealed fibroadipose tissue and hemorrhage with inflammatory cell infiltration. As the pathology was considered indeterminant, an excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. Pathology from the excisional biopsy confirmed breast panniculitis, consisting of fibroadipose tissue with prominent inflammation and fibrotic change in a vague perivascular pattern (Figure ).

Twenty-four hours urine examination showed a total urine volume of 4900 ml. Urine protein: creatinine ratio was 0.27.\nUltrasound showed right kidney measuring 8.9 cm × 3.4 cm and left kidney 9.2 cm × 4.0 cm with normal echotexture.\nTwo-dimensional echocardiogram revealed moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left atrium was dilated, valves were normal. There was aortic regurgitation, moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction and Grade I left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\nRenal Doppler showed diffuse wall thickening with more than 90% diffuse luminal stenosis bilaterally. Distal renal arteries were poorly visualized and show decreased flow velocities. Intrarenal parenchymal arteries showed reverse flow pattern. Right renal artery showed a peak systolic velocity of 31 cm/s while the left renal artery had a peak systolic velocity of 46 cm/s. Proximal aorta showed diffuse wall thickening and decreased caliber (aorto arteritis with B/L proximal RAS of > 90%).\nComputed tomography (CT) angiogram showed 60–70% stenosis of renal arteries at origin bilaterally [].

She had no significant past medical history and was not on any regular medications. Her most recent travel had been to Spain a few months previously, and she lived at home with her husband and dog, who were in good health. Her GP performed some blood tests, shown in , which prompted urgent referral for admission to hospital due to the notably raised white cell count and CRP.\nIn the Emergency Department the patient was pyrexic with a temperature of 39.4 °C. Otherwise, her observations were normal. She had no audible murmurs and the rest of her examination was unremarkable.\nChest X-ray was normal and ECG showed sinus rhythm with a rate of 76 beats per minute and first-degree AV block. One set of blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and she was started on IV piperacillin/tazobactam for pyrexia of unknown origin. She was tested for influenza by PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab, which was negative.\nTransthoracic echocardiography (TTE), carried out on day 2 of admission, demonstrated a mass on the aortic valve, which was further characterized by trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TOE), identifying a 1.8×0.9 cm mass with thickening of the aortic root, suspicious for root abscess.\nOn day 2 of admission, when the TTE raised the suspicion of endocarditis, she had seven further sets of blood cultures sent over a period of 72 h and was changed to IV amoxicillin 2 g 4 hourly, and gentamicin 3 mg kg−1 OD, as empirical treatment for native valve infective endocarditis.\nShe was transferred to cardiac surgery on day 4 of admission and underwent aortic valve replacement surgery (). Procedure note from Cardiothoracics as follows: ‘Via oblique aortotomy, tri-leaflet valve was seen with a huge vegetation and perforation at the annulus. There was a small abscess cavity in the annulus at the non-coronary cusp. The native valve was excised, and the cavity was debrided easily, with rifampicin washout. A size 21 Inspiris Reslia bioprosthetic valve was implanted in annular position with 15× Ethibond 2/0 interrupted technique (5 Teflon pledgeted at the Non coronary cusp area). Aorta closed in single layer, using Haemoseal pledgeted sutures. De-aired. Cross-clamp off. Right Ventricular pacing wire inserted and checked. Weaned off Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass. Good valve function with no paravalvular leak and adequate de-airing confirmed on Trans-oesophageal ECHO. Mediastinal and pericardial drains inserted. Protamine given, haemostasis checked/effected.’\nThe valve was sent by the cardiac surgeons to the microbiology laboratory for culture, and sent away for 16s PCR testing. It was not sent to histopathology.\nOn day 5 of admission, the aerobic bottle of the first set of blood cultures taken flagged positive after being incubated in Bact T/Alert 3-D (bioMérieux, France) for 3.5 days. Gram-negative rods were observed on Gram stain (). Given this information, the patient’s antibiotics were changed to ceftriaxone, vancomycin and gentamicin, whilst waiting for culture and identification of this organism. Subculture on Columbia blood agar yielded fine smooth, creamy white and non-haemolytic colonies. Species identification was performed using Vitek MS [matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)], which confirmed the organism as C. carnimorsus. As there were no recommended European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) antibiotic breakpoints, E-test strips were set up and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured against EUCAST PK-PD (non-species-related) breakpoints. This organism was susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, penicillin, ciprofloxacin and meropenem. The remaining sets of blood cultures were all negative after 5 days of incubation.\nGiven the identification of this organism, the patient’s antibiotic therapy was changed to Meropenem, Vancomycin and Gentamicin pending susceptibility testing. The heart valve was cultured and was negative after 7 days of incubation in enrichment broth. The valve was also sent to the Public Health England reference laboratory for 16S rDNA real-time PCR identification. Report: this identified species, with data indicating a 99 % sequence homology to C. cynodegmi, C. canimorsus and C. stomatis, providing robust evidence to confirm the responsible pathogen. The patient’s treatment was, therefore, targeted towards C. canimorusus, based on the antibiotic susceptibility test results () obtained through E-test, which were interpreted using EUCAST non-species-specific PK-PD breakpoints. Her antibiotic therapy was changed to IV benzylpenicillin, to complete 4 weeks of treatment.\nThe patient improved clinically and was discharged home after completion of treatment and a repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed normal left ventricular function and prosthetic aortic valve, with a repeat ECHO and follow-up planned in 1 year.", "Question": "What is the patient’s score of Wells' criteria for Pulmonary Embolism?", "Relevant Entities": "{'Previously Documented Pulmonary Embolism': False, 'Heart Rate or Pulse': [76.0, 'beats per minute'], 'Previously documented Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Immobilization for at least 3 days': False, 'Hemoptysis': False, 'Surgery in the previous 4 weeks': True, 'Clinical signs and symptoms of Deep Vein Thrombosis': False, 'Malignancy with treatment within 6 months or palliative': False, 'Pulmonary Embolism is #1 diagnosis OR equally likely': False}", "Ground Truth Answer": "1.5", "Lower Limit": "1.425", "Upper Limit": "1.575", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The Well's score for pulmonary embolism is currently 0.\nClinical signs and symptoms of DVT are repoted to be absent and so the total score remains unchanged, keeping the total score at 0.
